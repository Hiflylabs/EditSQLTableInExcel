# EditSQLTableInExcel

## Import, edit and generate data for SQL Server in Excel.

EditSQLTableInExcel is an Excel Add-in that provides users a way to import and edit table data in Excel. 
It has been designed to be a simple tool for data analysts to manipulate SQL data without having to write scripts. 
It also offers powerful data generation in order to generate sample data for a SQL database. 

This Add-in is heavily based on Pieter van der Westhuizen's (Pietervdw) SQL Server for Excel Add-in which is available at [https://github.com/Pietervdw/SQLForExcel](https://github.com/Pietervdw/SQLForExcel).
This version fixes multiple bugs found in the original Add-in, and no longer needs [Add-in Express for Office and .net](https://www.add-in-express.com/add-in-net/index.php) in order to build and run the project.
